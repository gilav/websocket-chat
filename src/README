A chat build using NodeJs

This is an upgrade of a nodejs chat created by Nikolay Anastasov, taken from: https://tutorialzine.com/2014/03/nodejs-private-webchat

My modifications are:
- Allow  multiple peoples per room
- typescrypt it
- try to implement a video chat session, using WebRTC demonstrator at https://appr.tc/r/
